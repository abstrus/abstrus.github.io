title: Hello World !
---

How else could I name a first post on a blog ?  Hello World !  Hello blogosphere !
Hello readers !  Hello coders !

There is no point in writing any *hello world* software longer than a few lines. The
same principle applies to blogs.  

The interesting stuff should come online pretty soon.  Code-fu stuff, of course !
