    <p>
      My name is Charles Bouchard-Légaré. I code stuff in php for a living at
      <a href="http://www.idealtechnology.net/english">Ideal Technology</a>
      in Quebec City, Canada.  I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and
      Computer Science (or will have by the end of April) and was a jeweller
      before that career change.  English is not my native language but I'll
      do my best to avoid any spelling mistakes.

      The name <em>abstrus</em> is old French (and German) for 
      <em>obscure, difficult to understand</em>. The word <em>abstruse</em> is
      equivalent in English.
